# GC352QW - Ranzirna postaja Zalog

To find the cache you have to solve a puzzle from the field of train switching/shunting (what else!). 
We have chosen an Inglenook Shunting Puzzle where we have a particular track layout, a locomotive and 
8 wagons; the goal is to compose from initial setup a train consisting of 5 wagons and a locomotive, 
drawing as few moves as possible. For the purpose of this cache we slightly adjusted the original rules.
